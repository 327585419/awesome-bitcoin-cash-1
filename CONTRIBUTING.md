# Contributing Guide

1. Follow the existing format as closely as possible.
2. Make sure you put things in the right category!
3. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
4. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
5. Pat yourself on the back for contributing and making the community better.
